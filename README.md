# voeventdb.remote

A Python client-library for running remote queries against the [voeventdb]
[REST interface](http://voeventdb.4pisky.org). 

You can use this library to quickly and easily retrieve information
about transient astronomical events, for which alerts or follow-up data 
have been sent via the [VOEvent][] network.

A work in progress. Come back soon!
